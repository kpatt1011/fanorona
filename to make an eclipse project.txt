If you're opening eclipse for the first time, it should ask you to designate a workspace folder.
i suggest just specifying this on your computer outside of your github folder. that way you can link 
the project folder from the appropriate directory(i am not sure if eclipse uses full file pathnames, so it 
may look for something like C:/users/Ryan/Github on everyone's computer if I make a workspace in the github 
folder. 

once you specify the workspace for eclipse(just a folder where you will keep all eclipse projects), create 
a new project and save it to your workspace, and then just link the src folder from github using the directions above.
this will look in your github folder for the source files every time you open eclipse, so if you pull fresh files from
github and then open up eclipse there shouldn't be a need to re link the folder.
